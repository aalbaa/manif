  volume = {5},
  number = {46},
  pages = {1371},
  author = {Jérémie Deray and Joan Solà},
  title = {Manif: A micro {L}ie theory library for state estimation in robotics applications},
  journal = {Journal of Open Source Software}
}
```

You can also consider citing [this paper][jsola18] as follows:

```latex
@techreport{SOLA-18-Lie,
    Address = {Barcelona},
    Author = {Joan Sol\`a and Jeremie Deray and Dinesh Atchuthan},
    Institution = {{Institut de Rob\`otica i Inform\`atica Industrial}},
    Number = {IRI-TR-18-01},
    Title = {A micro {L}ie theory for state estimation in robotics},
    Howpublished="\url{http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01537}",

```

Note that this reference is the one referred to throughout the code documentation.
Since this is a versioned work, please refer to [version 4, available here][jsola18v],
of the paper when cross-referencing with the **manif** documentation.
This will give the appropriate equation numbers.
